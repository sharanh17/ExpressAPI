 Set up version control by initializing a Git repository in your project directory.
  Install the Vercel extension for Visual Studio Code from the marketplace
   Push your Express.js application code to a GitHub repository.
   Use the Vercel extension in VS Code to deploy your project. Select the GitHub repository and choose the branch to deploy.
    Follow the prompts to configure deployment settings such as the project name and domain.
     Once deployment is initiated, monitor the process through the Vercel extension or the Vercel dashboard

    Working :
    1)Paste the vercel deployed link in postman 
    https://express-itfr6y46e-sharans-projects-afbc16c7.vercel.app/ 
    2) To createTask add /api/tasks and make POST request with body containing
    title and description
    Eg: 
    {
  "title": "Sample Task",
  "description": "This is a sample task description"
}
This is a POST call 

3)To getAllTasks make api call to 
 https://express-itfr6y46e-sharans-projects-afbc16c7.vercel.app/api/tasks
 This is a GET call


4)To update the status to completed add the :id to the api which we will get
 https://express-itfr6y46e-sharans-projects-afbc16c7.vercel.app/api/tasks/:id

 replace :id with the one you get in postman 
 This Is a PUT call

5)To delete the task mention the :id  iin the api call 
https://express-itfr6y46e-sharans-projects-afbc16c7.vercel.app/api/tasks/:id

This is a DELETE Call


by default when you paste only the link 
https://express-itfr6y46e-sharans-projects-afbc16c7.vercel.app/  the '/' path 
it will show 
 Welcome to the API
